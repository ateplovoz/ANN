# ANN
ANN is an acronym for "artifical neural network" â€” this repository contains all work that
i done so far

ANN is 2-year master degree project done by MPEI university student Vadim Pribylov.
The goal is to develop a way for various functions approximation bases on experimental data.

The defence of this project scheduled on mid-June.

Next step in development of this project is to achieve a controller architecture based on
ANN which hopefully will be able to adapt and re-tune itself on the fly.
